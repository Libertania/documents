# Economy, Trade and Bitcoin

The city will have it's own economy, separated from the Norwegian economy. 

Everything within the city-limits will be traded with bitcoins or other alternative currencies. 

There will also be a bitcoin-exchange in the city, where visitors and residents can exchange 
their national currencies for bitcoin.
