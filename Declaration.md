# Why do we want to create a private city

As anarchist, we do not support the current social system which is based on threats, force and violence to operate. We do not believe a large group of people have the rights to use force and violence against a single individual, or a minority of individuals. But that is exactly how a democratic system works

In a democratic system, the majority rules. Even if they are unmoral or destructive. And they can impose any laws and rules on the minority as they see fit. If the minority don't follow these rules and laws, they will be punished in various ways. And people who are aware of the current unmoral system we have to day, will never be able to change it through democratic elections,as we are a very small minority. We will not be able to change it through education, as the state has a monopoly on education.

This is one of the reasons we want to create a private city. In a private city where streets, sidewalks, parks, and everything else is privately owned, we have a chance to live closer to the life we want, and the life everybody deserves. People can choose to live there or not. In a democratic nation state, there is no escape. You follow the rules or you will get punished.
